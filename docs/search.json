After completing a problem by hand, slightly modify the conditions or variables (Figure 1) and solve it again. Then, input the new values into the Python script and compare the results with your hand-calculated solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Input parameters\n\n\n\n\nBuddy system: Study with a classmate. Teaching and helping one another significantly deepens understanding of the material. Students are strongly encouraged to work through problem sets collaboratively. For example, one student solves the odd-numbered problems while the other solves the even-numbered ones; then each explains their solutions to the other.\nPractice, practice, practice: As the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.” More accurately in this context, “good practice makes perfect.” That means pen-and-paper-first practice. Use Python as a verification tool, not a crutch. Always derive the solution analytically on paper first. Only after obtaining a complete hand-calculated result should you run the corresponding Python script. This approach echoes a proverb commonly attributed to Confucius:\n\nI hear and I forget\nI see and I remember\nI do and I understand\n\nMaintain a solution notebook: For each major problem, keep a single document (physical or digital) containing:\n\nThe full hand derivation\n\nKey numerical results with units\n\nA brief paragraph summarizing insights or reconciling any intermediate discrepancies\n\nThis record becomes an invaluable review resource before exams.",

We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.\nTo follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python (version 3.14 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. I recommend Positron, a beginner-friendly IDE with a built-in terminal, though other editors like VS Code or PyCharm are also good options.",

You can use multiple elif statements to test multiple conditions sequentially, and Python will execute the first True condition’s block, skipping the rest.\nelse: Executes a code block if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are True. It serves as a fallback and does not require a condition.\n\nThe following example uses age to categorize a person as a Minor, Adult, or Senior, demonstrating how if, elif, and else work together.\n# Categorize a person based on their age\nage = 19\nif age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"Minor\")\nelif age &lt;= 64:\n    print(\"Adult\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Senior\")\nOutput: Adult\n\n\nFor Loop\nA for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list or string).\ncomponents = [\"piston\", \"liner\", \"connecting rod\"]\nfor component in components:\n    print(component)\nOutput:\npiston\nliner\nconnecting rod\n\n\nWhile Loop\nA while loop executes as long as a condition is true.

Avoid abbreviations or single-letter names unless they are widely conventional (e.g., i as a loop index).\nOrganize code with consistent sectioning and clear headers or separators to enhance readability.\nRestrict line length to a maximum of 79 characters to ensure compatibility with print media and prevent horizontal overflow.\nInclude meaningful inline comments where necessary to explain the purpose and intent of the code, particularly for complex logic.\n\nMany modern Python projects enhance PEP 8 compliance by employing Black, the uncompromising code formatter.

It can be understood as a form of “sluggishness” inherent to matter. For an object at rest, a net force is required to set it in motion; the greater the mass, the greater the force needed. Similarly, if an object is already moving, a net force is required to change its speed or direction, and the magnitude of this force is again proportional to the mass.",

    "text": "2.4 Linear momentum\nLinear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the motion of an object. It is defined as the product of the object’s mass and its velocity. Because momentum is a vector quantity, it possesses both magnitude and direction.\n\\[\nLinear\\ momentum = m \\vec{v}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nLinear momentum is in kg·m/s.\n\\(m\\) is the mass of the object in kilograms.\n\\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the object in meters per second.\n\n\n2.4.1 Conservation of Linear Momentum\nThe law of conservation of linear momentum states that, in a closed system with no external forces (or when the net external force is zero), the total linear momentum remains constant over time. This principle is particularly evident in collisions between two bodies. During a collision, the force exerted by the first body on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second on the first (Newton’s third law). These equal and opposite forces act for the same duration, producing changes in momentum that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, the momentum gained by one body exactly equals the momentum lost by the other. Therefore, the total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.\nIn the absence of external forces, linear momentum is neither created nor destroyed; it is conserved. This is known as the law of conservation of linear momentum.\n\nExample 2.2 A jet of fresh water, 20 mm in diameter, emerges horizontally from a nozzle at a speed of 21 m/s and strikes a stationary vertical plate normally.

Key principles include Pascal’s law (pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions), Archimedes’ principle (buoyant force on a submerged body equals the weight of displaced fluid), and the hydrostatic pressure distribution in a fluid column, expressed as \\(p = \\rho g h\\), where \\(p\\) is gauge pressure, \\(\\rho\\) is fluid density, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration, and \\(h\\) is depth below the free surface.\nIn fluid mechanics, pressure head is the height of a fluid column that corresponds to a specific pressure at a given point, assuming the fluid is static. It’s expressed as \\(h_p = \\frac{p}{\\rho g}\\), where \\(p\\) is the pressure above atmospheric, \\(\\rho\\) is the fluid density, and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The unit is typically meters (or feet) of the fluid column.

    "text": "4.1 Volume Flow Rate\nHydrodynamics, a branch of fluid mechanics, studies the motion of liquids and the forces acting on them. Unlike aerodynamics, which concerns compressible gases such as air, hydrodynamics primarily deals with incompressible fluids like water. It is based on classical physics principles, including Newton’s laws of motion, the conservation of mass and momentum. These principles are used to describe the velocity, pressure and viscosity of a fluid in motion.\nVolume rate of flow refers to the rate at which a fluid volume passes a given section in a flow stream. Volume rate of flow may also be referred to as capacity of flow, flow rate or discharge. It is generally given in units of volume per unit of time, cubic meters per second (m3/s) or liters per second (L/s).\nConsider an ideal fluid flow in a pipe of cross-section ‘A’ (m2). For an ideal fluid all the particles move to the right with a velocity of ‘C’ (m/s). As the fluid flow to the right with a velocity of C m/s, ‘C’ m of fluid pass section 1 every second. i.e. the volume of fluid passing section-1 every second is A x C.\n\\[\n\\dot{v} = A \\cdot C\n\\]\nWhere:\nConsider a real fluid flowing in the same pipe. Here particle velocity will be a variable across the flow stream.\nIf the mean velocity cm of all the fluid particles could be found, then similar to the ideal fluid.\n\\[\nVolume\\ flow = area\\ x\\ mean\\ velocity\n\\]\nUnless otherwise indicated, the velocity of flow is understood to refer to the average or mean velocity of all the particles in a flowing fluid.",

The coefficient of velocity, \\(C_v\\), is defined as the ratio of actual velocity to theoretical velocity. Thus, the velocity-corrected flow rate is: \\[\n\\dot{v}_{\\text{velocity-corrected}} = C_v A \\sqrt{2gh}\n\\]\nDownstream of a sharp-edged orifice, the jet contracts due to streamline curvature, forming a vena contracta (Figure 4.2). The vena contracta refers to the narrowest cross-section of a fluid jet shortly downstream of an orifice or nozzle, where the streamlines converge, resulting in the smallest area, maximum velocity, and minimum pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Vena contracta\n\n\n\nThe coefficient of contraction, \\(C_A\\), is the ratio of the jet area at the vena contracta to the orifice area: \\[\nA_{\\text{jet}} = C_A A\n\\]\nThe actual volume flow rate therefore becomes: \\[\n\\dot{v}_{\\text{actual}} = C_A A \\cdot C_v \\sqrt{2gh}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of discharge, \\(C_d\\), is the ratio of the actual volume flow rate to the theoretical volume flow rate: \\[\nC_d = C_A \\cdot C_v\n\\]\nConsequently, \\[\n\\dot{v}_{\\text{actual}} = C_d A \\sqrt{2gh}\n\\]\n\nExample 4.2 Water escapes through a hole 20 mm in diameter in the side of a tank, with a water head of 3 m above the hole.

    "text": "4.5 The Energy Equation for an Ideal Fluid\nThe steady flow equation is developed from the Law of Conservation of Energy. If there are no energy losses or energy additions in a flow system, then the total energy of a flowing fluid will remain constant.\nA flowing fluid may lose energy as a result of fluid friction, heat energy transfer and fluid motors. For an ideal fluid, frictional losses are equal to zero. Energy may be added to a fluid via a pump or heat energy addition.\nThe total energy possessed by a flowing fluid consists of:\n\ninternal energy\npotential energy\nkinetic energy and\npressure energy (flow energy).\n\nGenerally in fluid mechanics the change in internal energy is considered to be negligible. Heat energy transfers are usually not considered in fluid mechanics and the frictional heat developed by a flowing fluid is relatively small. Therefore, the internal energy term is omitted from the energy balance.\nConsider the flow system shown in Figure 4.4. For this system, assume:\n\nan ideal fluid\nthat there are no energy losses or additions and\nsteady flow conditions exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Energy equation\n\n\n\nFrom the Law of Conservation of Energy:\nThe Total Energy at section 1 = The Total Energy at section 2\n\\[\nmZ_1g+\\frac{m C_1^2}{2}+mP_1v_1=mZ_2g+\\frac{m C_2^2}{2}+mP_2v_2\n\\]\nDividing through by \\(mg\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{mZ_1g}{mg}+\\frac{m C_1^2}{2mg}+\\frac{mP_1v_1}{mg}=\\frac{mZ_2g}{mg}+\\frac{m C_2^2}{2mg}+\\frac{mP_2v_2}{mg}\n\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\nZ_1+\\frac{C_1^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_1v_1}{g}=Z_2+\\frac{C_2^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_2v_2}{g}\n\\]\nIn fluid mechanics density (\\(\\rho\\)) is generally used in preference to specific volume, i.e. \\(v=\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\) Therefore:\n\\[\nZ_1+\\frac{C_1^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_1}{g\\rho_1}=Z_2+\\frac{C_2^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_2}{g\\rho_2}\n\\]\nIn fluid mechanics, specific weight represents the force exerted by gravity on a unit volume of a fluid. For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., \\(N/m^3\\))\nSpecific weight is given \\(\\gamma = g\\rho\\)\nWhere:\n\\(\\gamma\\): specific weight, \\(\\mathrm{N/m^3}\\)\n\\(g\\): gravitational acceleration, \\(\\mathrm{m/s^2}\\)\n\\(\\rho\\): density, \\(\\mathrm{kg/m^3}\\)\n\\[\nZ_1+\\frac{C_1^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_1}{\\gamma_1}=Z_2+\\frac{C_2^2}{2g}+\\frac{P_2}{\\gamma_2}\n\\]\nEach term has units of m, therefore:\n\nPotential energy \\(Z\\) is known as the elevation head.\nKinetic energy \\(\\frac{c^2}{2g}\\) is known as the velocity head.\nPressure energy \\(\\frac{P}{\\gamma}\\) is known as the pressure head.\n\nSimilarly, the total energy of a flowing fluid is known as the total head (H).\n\\[\nTotal\\ Head= Elevation\\ Head + Velocity\\ Head + Pressure\\ Head\n\\] \\[\nH=Z+\\frac{C^2}{2g}+\\frac{P}{\\gamma}\n\\]\nThe total head (H) will be a constant throughout a flow system if:\n\nfrictional losses (head loss) are equal to zero\nwork energy is not added by a pump (pump head) or removed by a motor.\n\n\nExample 4.4 Consider a simple flow system consisting of a varying cross-section pipe. Water flows through this system at a rate of 2000 L/min. As the pipe increases in elevation from 30 m to 36 m it decreases in diameter from 10 cm to 3.0 cm.
