    "text": "Preface\nA Concise Introduction to Computational Tools provides a series of tutorials derived from lecture notes, offering clear and focused guidance on essential topics. No prior programming experience is required.\nStudents are expected to be comfortable with college-level mathematics and science and are strongly encouraged to consult reliable reference texts. For example, foundational and practical texts in mathematics, applied mechanics and computational tools, including Bird (2021), Hannah & Hillier (1995), Russell et al. (2021), Bolton (2021), Shaw (2017), Sweigart (2021), and Sweigart (2020).\nThe tutorials also assume working familiarity with either macOS or Microsoft Windows. For best results, these materials should be used on a laptop or desktop computer rather than a tablet or smartphone.\n\n\n\n\nBird, J. O. (2021). Bird’s engineering mathematics (Ninth edition).
