# Dynamics {#dynamics}

Dynamics\index{Dynamics} is the branch of mechanics that studies the motion of bodies under the action of forces. This chapter examines situations where forces produce acceleration, and it presents methods for analyzing the resulting motion, including the application of Newton’s laws, energy principles, and momentum conservation.

## Inertia

Inertia is the property of a body that resists any change in its state of motion and is directly proportional to its mass. It can be understood as a form of “sluggishness” inherent to matter. For an object at rest, a net force is required to set it in motion; the greater the mass, the greater the force needed. Similarly, if an object is already moving, a net force is required to change its speed or direction, and the magnitude of this force is again proportional to the mass.

::: callout-note
The tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion. An object with greater mass has greater inertia (it is “harder to start or stop”).

-   In **Naval Architecture**, the *moment of inertia* (units: m⁴) is a measure of resistance to bending (related to stiffness/deflection of beams and hull girders).
-   In **angular motion and physics**, the *moment of inertia* (units: kg·m²) is a measure of resistance to angular acceleration (rotational inertia).

## Momentum

Momentum is the product of an object’s mass and its velocity and quantifies the amount of motion a moving body possesses. This concept is particularly important when considering a large vessel approaching a dock. Once the vessel is underway, its considerable momentum means that a substantial force, applied over sufficient time, is required to bring it to a stop or significantly alter its course. Without such intervention, the vessel will not stop quickly on its own and may collide with the dock.

## Newton's Laws of Motion

1.  **First Law (Law of Inertia)**:\
    An object remains at rest, or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by a net external force.\
    $$
    \Sigma F = 0 \implies v = \text{constant}
    $$

2.  **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**:\
    The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\
    $$
    \vec{F} = m \vec{a}
    $$

3.  **Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**:\
    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\
    $$
    \vec{F}_{\text{action}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{reaction}}
    $$

## Linear momentum

Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the motion of an object. It is defined as the product of the object’s mass and its velocity. Because momentum is a vector quantity, it possesses both magnitude and direction.

$$
Linear\ momentum = m \vec{v}
$$

Where:

-   Linear momentum is in kg·m/s.

-   $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms.

-   $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object in meters per second.

### Conservation of Linear Momentum

The law of conservation of linear momentum states that, in a closed system with no external forces (or when the net external force is zero), the total linear momentum remains constant over time. This principle is particularly evident in collisions between two bodies. During a collision, the force exerted by the first body on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second on the first (Newton’s third law). These equal and opposite forces act for the same duration, producing changes in momentum that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, the momentum gained by one body exactly equals the momentum lost by the other. Therefore, the total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

In the absence of external forces, linear momentum is neither created nor destroyed; it is conserved. This is known as the law of conservation of linear momentum.

## Angular Momentum

Angular momentum is the moment of linear momentum about a chosen point or axis. For a single particle, it is given by the cross product of its position vector (measured from that point) and its linear momentum.

More broadly, angular momentum measures the rotational motion of a system. For extended bodies, its evaluation depends on both the distance of mass elements from the axis (the first moment of position) and how the mass is distributed throughout the object—the moment of inertia, or second moment of mass.


Given **linear velocity** $\vec{v}$ and **angular velocity** $\omega$:

$$
\vec{v} = r \omega
$$

The **linear momentum** is determined by:

$$
\text{Linear momentum} = m \vec{v}
$$

Substituting for $\vec{v}$:

$$
\text{Linear momentum} = m r \omega
$$

The **moment of linear momentum** can then be written as:

$$
\text{Moment of linear momentum} = m r \omega r
$$

The moment of linear momentum is referred to as the **angular momentum**. Simplifying the above equation:

$$
\text{Angular momentum} = m r^2 \omega
$$

Here, $m r^2$ is the **moment of inertia** (second moment of mass) of the object about its axis of rotation, denoted as $I$. Thus, the angular momentum can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Angular momentum} = I \omega
$$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $kg·m²$.
-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in $rad/s$.

Additionally, the moment of inertia $I$ is given by:

$$
I = m k^2
$$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $kg·m²$.
-   $m$ is the mass in $kg$.
-   $k$ is the radius of gyration in $m$.

::: callout-note
In structural engineering, the moment of inertia (m⁴) is a measure of resistance to bending (deflection or stiffness).

In angular motion and physics, the moment of inertia (kg·m²) is a measure of resistance to angular acceleration (rotational inertia).
:::

## The Radius of Gyration

A geometric property of a rigid body that indicates how the mass is distributed relative to a specified axis of rotation. It is defined such that:

$$I = m k^2$$

where\
- $I$ = moment of inertia (kg·m²)\
- $m$ = total mass (kg)\
- $k$ = radius of gyration (m)

::: callout-note
-   **Smaller** $k$ → mass is concentrated closer to the axis → **lower** rotational inertia\
    → easier/faster to speed up or slow down rotation\
    (e.g., engine crankshafts, turbine rotors, figure skater pulling arms in).

-   **Larger** $k$ → mass is distributed farther from the axis → **higher** rotational inertia\
    → better for storing rotational energy\
    (e.g., flywheels; a hollow cylinder has a larger $k$ than a solid cylinder of the same mass and outer radius).

## Turning Moment

We know the relation between linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$:

$$
a = r \alpha
$$

And

$$
F = ma
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = m \alpha r
$$

If the force is not applied directly on the rim but at a greater or lesser leverage, say $L$ from the centre, the effective force on the rim causing it to accelerate will be greater or lesser accordingly, in the ratio of $L$ to $r$. Thus:

$$
F \frac{L}{r} = m \alpha r
$$

Multiplying both sides by $r$,

$$
FL = m \alpha r^2
$$

Now, $FL$ is the torque applied. Therefore, the accelerating torque is:

$$
\tau = m r^2 \alpha
$$

Or,

$$
\tau = m k^2 \alpha
$$

$\tau$ is also given by:

$$
\tau = I \alpha
$$

Where:

-   $\tau$ is the torque in $Nm$.
-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $kg·m²$.
-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration in $rad/s^2$.

## Power by Torque

Consider a force $F$ applied at a radius $r$ on a rotating mechanism. The work done in one revolution is the product of the force and the circumference. Therefore:

$$
W = F \cdot 2 \pi r
$$

If the mechanism is running at $n$ revolutions per second:

$$
\text{Power} = F \cdot 2 \pi r n
$$

Since torque $\tau = F r$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
P = \tau \cdot 2 \pi n
$$

Given that $\omega = 2 \pi n$:

$$
P = \tau \cdot \omega
$$

Where:

-   $P$ is the power in watts (W),
-   $\tau$ is the torque in newton-meters (Nm), and
-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

## Kinetic Energy of Rotation

We know that $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the body. For a rotating body, the effective linear velocity is at the radius of gyration, as this is the radius at which the entire mass of the rotating body can be considered to act.

Let $k$ = radius of gyration (in meters),\
Let $\omega$ = angular velocity (in radians per second).

The relationship between linear and angular velocity is:

$$
v = \omega k
$$

Substituting $v^2 = \omega^2 k^2$ into $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ gives:

$$
\text{Rotational K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} m k^2 \omega^2
$$

Since $I = m k^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia:

$$
\text{Rotational K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
