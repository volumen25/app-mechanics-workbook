# Statics {#statics}

Mechanics is the branch of physics and engineering concerned with the behavior of bodies under the action of forces, encompassing statics and dynamics. This chapter introduces statics\index{Statics}, the study of bodies in equilibrium where net forces and moments are zero. We examine balanced force systems, including space and vector diagrams, conditions of equilibrium, and the calculation of resultant forces and moments.

## Space Diagrams

A space diagram\index{Space diagram} illustrates the geometry of the system and the applied forces.

![Space Diagram](images/spacedia.png){#fig-spacedia width="75%"}

## Vector Diagrams

A vector diagram\index{Vector diagram} (or force polygon) is a **scaled** graphical construction in which force vectors are placed head-to-tail in succession. It is used to determine the resultant of a system of forces through vector addition, as well as to resolve equilibrium problems when the polygon closes.

![Vector Diagram](images/vectordia.png){#fig-vectordia}

### Resultant

The resultant is a single force that has exactly the same effect on an object as all the original forces acting together. It is found by adding the forces vectorially taking into account both their magnitude and direction. The resultant gives the overall direction and magnitude of the combined forces as shown in @fig-vectordia.

### Equilibrium

Equilibrium of an object occurs when all the forces acting on it are balanced, so the object remains at rest or moves at a constant speed in a straight line. In equilibrium, as shown in @fig-equilibrant, there is no net force or acceleration, meaning the object is in a stable state without any change in its motion.

![Equilibrant](images/vectordia-equilibrant.png){#fig-equilibrant}

## Conditions of Equilibrium

1.  Net force must be zero:

$$
\sum_{k} \vec{F}_{k} = \vec{0}
$$ {#eq-force}

2.  Net torque must be zero:

$$
\sum_{k} \vec{\tau}_{k} = \vec{0}
$$ {#eq-torque}

## Cosine Rule

![Rules of Cosine and Sine](images/sinecosrule.png){#fig-law_cos_sine}

The Cosine Rule\index{Cosine rule} is used to relate the lengths of the sides of a triangle as shown in @fig-law_cos_sine to the cosine of one of its angles:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos \gamma
$$ {#eq-cos}

Where:

-   a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

-   $\gamma$ is the angle opposite side c.

## Sine Rule

The Sine Rule\index{Sine rule} relates the sides and angles of a triangle in @fig-law_cos_sine:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma}
$$ {#eq-sine}

Where:

-   $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are the angles of the triangle.

-   a, b, c are the sides of the triangle opposite to angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ respectively.

## Problem Set

:::: {#exm-1_6}
Two slings of equal length are slung from a horizontal beam and connected to a ring at their lower ends, the slings and beam forming an equilateral triangle. Find the force in each sling when a load of 30 kN hangs from the ring.

::: callout-warning
In Python, the trigonometric functions in the `math` module (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.) expect angles in radians, not degrees. Always convert degrees to radians before using these functions.
