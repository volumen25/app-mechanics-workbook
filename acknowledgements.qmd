# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues and friends for their helpful feedback and kind support during this project. In no particular order, I wish to thank Bill Frisell, Julian Lage, Hirofumi Asaba, and Kenny Vaughan. Any errors or omissions are entirely my own.

Last but not least, I am grateful to my wife for her patience and support as I spent our weekends and holidays working on this project.
