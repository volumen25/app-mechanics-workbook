# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I wish to thank Russell Oye, Michele Bridge, and her team for their support of my proposal, *Beyond the Calculator: Hands-On Learning with Computational Tools*, and for encouraging me to get this project started.

I would also like to express my sincere thanks to my students for their honest feedback throughout this project, as well as to my colleague Natalie Twohey for reviewing the text and Python scripts. Any errors or omissions are my own.

Last but not least, I am grateful to my wife for her patience and support while I spent our weekends and holidays working on this project.
