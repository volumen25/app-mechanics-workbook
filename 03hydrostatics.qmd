# Hydrostatics {#sec-hydrostatics}

Hydrostatics\index{Hydrostatics} is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest and the forces and pressures they exert on immersed or containing surfaces. Key principles include Pascal’s law (pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions), Archimedes’ principle (buoyant force on a submerged body equals the weight of displaced fluid), and the hydrostatic pressure distribution in a fluid column, expressed as $p = \rho g h$, where $p$ is gauge pressure, $\rho$ is fluid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is depth below the free surface.

## Pressure Head

In fluid mechanics, pressure head is the height of a fluid column that corresponds to a specific pressure at a given point, assuming the fluid is static. It’s expressed as $h_p = \frac{p}{\rho g}$, where $p$ is the pressure above atmospheric, $\rho$ is the fluid density, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The unit is typically meters (or feet) of the fluid column. Pressure head represents the potential energy per unit weight due to pressure and is a component of the total hydraulic head, which is the sum of pressure head and elevation head.

## Load On Immersed Surfaces

The load on an immersed surface is the total hydrostatic force exerted by a fluid on a surface submerged in a static fluid. This force arises from the pressure variation with depth, governed by the hydrostatic pressure equation $p = \rho g h$, where $\rho$ is fluid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is the depth below the free surface.

The pressure acts perpendicular to the surface, resulting in a distributed load. The total force $F$ is calculated as $F = \rho g A \bar{h}$, where $A$ is the surface area and $\bar{h}$ is the depth of the centroid of the area.

## Hydraulic Jacks

Hydraulic jacks use Pascal’s law to lift heavy loads with minimal input force. Pascal’s law states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. In a hydraulic jack as shown in @fig-hyd_jack , two pistons of different sizes are connected by a confined fluid. Applying an effort force to the smaller piston generates a pressure that is transmitted to the larger piston, producing an output force. Calculations involving hydraulic jacks, such as determining system pressure, required input force, or lifted load, rely on this principle under ideal conditions, neglecting friction and fluid compressibility.
